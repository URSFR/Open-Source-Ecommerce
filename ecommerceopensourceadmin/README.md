OSEAdmin

## Getting Started
THIS IS A OPEN SOURCE ECOMMERCE ADMIN PANEL MADE BY ME (Rodrigo), YOU CAN USE THIS FOR FREE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO GIVE CREDITS, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IT BY REDIRECTING TO THIS GITHUB

Contains:
Login (You have to create a EMAIL-PASSWORD Account to log in)
Admin Panel with Dashboard, Product Creation, Product List, Order List and Control, Account Elimination
Logout
You can manage orders by accept, shipping, arriving and cancel
You can manage and delete products
You can delete accounts with user requests


Notes: THIS WAS ONLY TESTED ON WEB, All Firebase auth and connections was removed, you have to adapt to your own Firebase
Requirements: Firestore (WEB), Firebase Realtime Database (WEB), Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage

I do not provide any type of support when referring to open source but in case of errors in my free time I can solve them
