An Open Source Ecommerce

## Getting Started
THIS IS A OPEN SOURCE ECOMMERCE MADE BY ME (Rodrigo), YOU CAN USE THIS FOR FREE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO GIVE CREDITS, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IT BY REDIRECTING TO THIS GITHUB

Contains:
Register and Login by phone
Search Products and filter by category and price
Product Details
Cart
Profile
Logout

Notes: THIS WAS ONLY TESTED ON ANDROID, All Firebase auth and connections was removed, you have to adapt to your own Firebase
Requirements: Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage

I do not provide any type of support when referring to open source but in case of errors in my free time I can solve them
